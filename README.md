# Minecraft AFK Bot

This is a simple **Minecraft bot** built using the **mineflayer** library. The bot can automatically join a Minecraft server, stay active by preventing AFK kicks, and respond to private messages from players. It can also be extended to perform additional tasks like mining diamonds for players who request it.

## Features

- **Anti-AFK**: The bot automatically performs actions (such as jumping) to stay active and prevent being kicked for inactivity.
- **Responds to Private Messages**: The bot listens for `/msg` commands and can respond by performing tasks like mining diamonds for the player who requested it.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to configure and run with just a few steps.
- **Extendable**: You can customize the botâ€™s actions or add new features to suit your needs.

## Requirements

Before running the bot, you will need:

- **Node.js**: Install [Node.js] (version 14 or higher).
- **Minecraft Server**: A Minecraft Java Edition server to connect to.
- **Java**: Ensure you have the latest version of Java to run the Minecraft server.
